"""
train-bridge.py -- persistent, incremental bridge training.
Now with automated video downloading from Hugging Face baked into the
embedding step -- no more manually placing .mp4 files next to the script.

WORKFLOW:
  1. Put ~10 new (video_id, question, answer) entries in NEW_BATCH below.
     video_path is no longer needed -- the script downloads each video by
     video_id automatically.
  2. Run this script. It will:
       - download any NEW_BATCH videos not already embedded
       - embed them, cache the (tiny) embedding, then leave the raw .mp4
         on disk (deletion is NOT automatic -- delete manually when ready)
       - load the existing bridge checkpoint (or init fresh if none exists)
       - train on the full library (old + new) for TIME_BUDGET_SECONDS
       - save the updated checkpoint back to BRIDGE_CHECKPOINT_PATH
       - report a quick held-out eval if the library is big enough
  3. Delete downloaded videos yourself once you're done with them, from
     SAVE_DIR (see below) -- this script will not do it for you.
  4. Next session: fill NEW_BATCH with the next 10 videos, repeat.
